## Technology

- Lumen
- Mysql
- Nginx
- Puppeteer

## Setup

1. Check volumns path in `docker-compose.yml`, but be sure that volumns path must be shared with docker.
    ```$xslt
    #  The Application
      app:
        container_name: crawl_nct
        build:
          context: ./
          dockerfile: development/app.dockerfile
        volumes:
          - ./storage:/var/www/storage  --> Changeit
        env_file: '.env.prod'
        environment:
          - "DB_HOST=database"
          - "REDIS_HOST=cache"
          
          
     # The Web Server
      web:
        container_name: nginx_server
        build:
          context: ./
          dockerfile: development/web.dockerfile
        volumes:
          - ./storage/logs/:/var/log/nginx  --> Changeit
        ports:
          - 8990:80
    ```

2. Check ports in `docker-compose.yml`, be sure that port number in the left side of the colon has not been used. Default port for `nginx web` is 8990
and default port for `database` is 8991.

    ```$xslt
    # The Web Server
      web:
        container_name: nginx_server
        build:
          context: ./
          dockerfile: development/web.dockerfile
        volumes:
          - ./storage/logs/:/var/log/nginx
        command: nginx -g "daemon off;"
        ports:
          - 8990:80
    
      # The Database
      database:
        container_name: mysql_database
        image: mysql:5.7
        volumes:
          - dbdata:/var/lib/mysql
        environment:
          - "MYSQL_DATABASE=nct"
          - "MYSQL_USER=phpmyadmin"
          - "MYSQL_PASSWORD=phpmyadmin"
          - "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root."
        ports:
          - 8991:3306
    ```

3. Update mysql database connection in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.prod`, but be sure 
that `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD` in `docker-compose.yml` must equal to
`DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` in `.env.prod` respectively:

    ```$xslt
    # docker-composer.yml
      database:
        container_name: mysql_database
        image: mysql:5.7
        volumes:
          - dbdata:/var/lib/mysql
        environment:
          - "MYSQL_DATABASE=nct"
          - "MYSQL_USER=phpmyadmin"
          - "MYSQL_PASSWORD=phpmyadmin"
          - "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root."
        ports:
          - 8991:3306
          
    # .env.prod
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=mysql_database
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=nct
    DB_USERNAME=phpmyadmin
    DB_PASSWORD=phpmyadmin
    
    ```

4. Run docker-compose
    ```$xslt
    docker-compose up -d --build database && docker-compose up -d --build app && docker-compose up -d --build web
    ```

5. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8990/` to check it worked or not. (8990 is the port of `nginx web`, change it if you has changed `nginx web` in `docker-compose.yml` file)

## How to use


1. Add a NCT playlist url to crawl.
    ```$xslt
        # If you want to crawl `https://www.nhaccuatui.com/playlist/nhac-tre-moi.html`
        Visit http://127.0.0.1:8990/playlist/crawl?url=https://www.nhaccuatui.com/playlist/nhac-tre-moi.html
    ``` 
    
    ***Note:*** 
    - When you visit this page, the system will add a `queue job` to crawl your url. The queue will auto restart
    with a `delay time = 60 seconds`, so be patient if you url has not been crawled. When the queue run through you url,
    it will get all the playlist link in your url and add to `playlists` table in database, but just only playlist's links.
    - There is another queue, called `crawl_detail:nct`. This queue is responsible for crawling playlist's detail information,
    such as `playlist name`, `playlist artists`, `playlist image` and all `media items` in the playlist.

2. Show all current playlist
    ```$xslt
        Just visit `http://127.0.0.1:8990/playlist`.
        You can see a table which show all current playlists
    ```

3. Show all playlist's song
    ```$xslt
        In the playlists table you saw on step 2, click on the name of any playlist you want.
        Now you can see a table of all songs belonged to the playlist.
    ```
    
4. Download the song
    ```$xslt
        In the s√≥ng table you saw on step 3, click on the name of any song you want to download.
        Wait for the file to download and open to enjoy.
    ```
    
## Update.
1. PHPMyAdmin
    Recently, i add service `phpmyadmin` to make database display easier on web. Be sure that, `phpmyadmin`'s
    environment database connection information matching with database connection information in service `database`.
